Docker Compose
-YAML file (yet another markup language)
-Used to run a multi-container Docker application
-Services - lists out all the containers in app
-Volumes - create named volumes or bind mounts that can be resued
	-volumes are used to persist data -> otherwise data is lost each time we close docker containers
	-bind mounts will link a directory or file on the host machine to a directory in the container
		-used for development bc we can change something in the container right away via the colume
	-named volumes are managed by Docker and good for production - easier to manage and better isolation
	-driver: local - driver defines storage driver used to manage volume
		-local - Docker will create a directory on host machine
	-driver_opts - more options
		type: none - no specific filesystem type (used with bind mounts)
		device: <location> - where volume will be mounted on host machine
		o: bind - bind mount
-Networks - define custom network for Services
	-the most common network driver used in Docker compose is bridge network driver
	-creates a virtual network on host machine and assigns ip addresses to each container
	-containers then use their assigned ip address inside inception network

NGINX
default.conf -> belongs in conf.d folder and is used to configure specific server settings
nginx.conf -> used for global settings

/var/log/nginx/error.log

ps aux | grep nginx
